# shakespeare-markdown

Formatting Shakespeare's complete works as markdown. Mostly done for the
Stratford Herbal project, but kept on its own as it might be useful
to someone.

The text is taken from the [MIT Shakespeare site](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/), 
which took its text from the Complete Moby(tm) Shakespeare.
